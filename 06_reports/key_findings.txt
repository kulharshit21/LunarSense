1. SINGLE MODALITY PERFORMANCE:
   ✅ ChaSTE (Thermal): Strong baseline (81% accuracy, 0.75 ROC-AUC)
   ⚠️ ILSA (Seismic): Weak individual performance (71% accuracy, 0.56 ROC-AUC)
      → Limited by sparse event distribution

2. MULTIMODAL FUSION:
   ✅ XGBoost Fusion: Best overall performance (0.75 ROC-AUC, 0.60 F1)
   ⚠️ Deep Learning: High recall (100%) but low precision (44%)
      → Overfits to predict all events

3. MODEL SELECTION:
   🏆 WINNER: XGBoost Fusion Model
      - Balanced performance across all metrics
      - ROC-AUC: 0.7476 (good discrimination)
      - F1-Score: 0.6032 (balanced precision-recall)
      - Interpretable feature importance

4. FUSION EFFECTIVENESS:
   ✅ Multimodal fusion stabilizes ILSA weakness
   ✅ Combines ChaSTE precision with ILSA recall
   ✅ ROC-AUC maintained at fusion level despite ILSA weakness

5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   ✅ ChaSTE alone sufficient for high-precision scenarios
   ✅ Fusion recommended for balanced detection needs
   ⚠️ Deep learning not suitable (too many false alarms)
