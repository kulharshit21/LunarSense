Dataset Preparation:
- Total ChaSTE samples: 385 (31.69% events)
- Total ILSA samples: 1,674 (20.07% events)
- Multimodal fusion: 385 paired samples
- Train/test split: 80/20 with stratification

Baseline Models (Single Modality):
ChaSTE (Thermal) achieved strong individual performance:
  • Accuracy: 81.82%, Precision: 81.25%, Recall: 54.17%
  • F1-Score: 0.6500, ROC-AUC: 0.7500
  • Demonstrates reliable thermal anomaly detection

ILSA (Seismic) showed limited individual capability:
  • Accuracy: 71.34%, Precision: 30.14%, Recall: 32.84%
  • F1-Score: 0.3143, ROC-AUC: 0.5649
  • Reflects challenges in sparse seismic event detection

Multimodal Fusion Model (XGBoost):
The fusion model successfully combined sensor modalities:
  • Accuracy: 67.53%, Precision: 65.52%, Recall: 55.88%
  • F1-Score: 0.6032, ROC-AUC: 0.7476
  • Achieved best ROC-AUC (0.7476), demonstrating superior 
    discrimination between events and non-events

Cross-Validation Results:
5-fold cross-validation confirmed model robustness:
  • Fusion F1: 0.7047 ± 0.0579
  • Fusion AUC: Mean consistent across folds

Deep Learning Comparison:
While deep learning achieved 100% recall, it resulted in 
excessive false positives (56% precision), making it impractical 
for deployment. Classical ML approach was preferred.

Conclusion:
Multimodal fusion stabilized weak single-modality detectors 
while maintaining strong performance, demonstrating the value 
of sensor fusion for lunar anomaly detection.
