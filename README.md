# LunarSense
LunarSense is a project built using the Chandrayaan-3 dataset to analyze lunar surface imagery, identify key geological or mission-related events, and compute optimal traversal routes across the Moon’s terrain. The project leverages image processing and path-planning techniques to extract insights from real lunar data.
